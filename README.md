Features:
*  Choose between both major ROM editors for compatibility.
*  Support for inputting a custom offset if the presets won't work for your setup.
*  Includes a patch to show the end screen on start to test your end screen. Note that this treats the game as finished and does not load any more of the game.
*  If not done already, extends an 8 MB to 64 MB. The resulting ROM should be compatible with both major editors, but there may be problems with ROM Manager. If so, there is a tweak that undoes SM64e changes in ROM Manager, try that; it might fix it.
